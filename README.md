# stm32_file_viewer
Project for testing and developing my libraries based on HAL drivers: https://github.com/SL-RU/stm32libs

Simple file viewer which opens text files and images. 

SD card over SPI. FAT system using Chan's FAT FS. SSD1306 0.96inch OLED display connected by I2C using my library. GUI using my gui lib.

Soon I will write article about all libraries.
